# fullstack-blog


Fullstack app, backend provided with node and mongoDB as database to store content of each memo.
In the future I plan also to connect to cloud service in order to store images for memos if user decides to add them.
Front-end is based on react, but as for now (20.03.22) I want to focus on functionality, leaving the design and visuals for the final touch.
Besides I'd like to to make this app secured by password and login and also to add visual side to form that allows user to add memos, for now it works in postman.
